		<p>For the excursion we went to an excursion named Robotanica. We could go to the opening night, but due to a hockeygame, I went a day later. It was on a very cool location, in Amsterdam you have a sort of art park, this is where the expo was. There were a lot of different projects, but my favourite was the Tumbleweed.</p>

	<div  class="text">
		<h3>The Tumbleweed</h3>
		<p>
			It was made by Shlomi Mir, he is an award-winning designer and designer, and lives in Tel Aviv. He made the tumbleweed and its purpose is to hold back the spreading of the dessert. It works on the power of the wind, that blows it somewhere else. As you can see, it looks like a very simple ball that captions wind, because of the sails that are wrapped around the robot. The Tumbleweed collects data, that is supposed to help scientist to know what occurs in the deepest of desserts.
		</p>

		<p>
			The data is collected, because the Tumbleweed rolls around with a great speed, a kinect generator produces energy for the computer, sensors and motor that are built in the robot. When it comes to an area that it finds interesting, it releases just enough seeds. When more Tumbleweeds do this, it creates a barrier to defend the seeds from the desert.
		</p>

		<p>
			Something that directly caught my eye, was the Arduino board that was in the robot. It was so out in the open and I thought by myself, well, if this robot contains an Arduino board, that means I will be able to make this in a few weeks as well. That was one of the main reasons I thought this was one of the best projects.

			But that was, of course, not the only reason. Lately, the environment is in the news a lot, and one of my best friends is going to study Science of Environment and teaches me much about what is going on in the world and how we need to do better in a lot of ways. Now, the Tumbleweed is not really about making the environment better, but it does help. With the data, there might be something that can help, because even at the driest dessert, it has rained, which shows us how the environment is changing. Someone might be inspired by this project and thinks of something that also helps the environment.
