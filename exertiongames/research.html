		<p>Next to coming up with a concept about exertion gaming, there was the research that had to be done. The research assignment is to look for two new examples of exertion games/interfaces and add the theory to those interfaces. </p>

		<h3>BubblePopper</h3>
		<p>This is one of the most simple exertion games I have seen, it is made with a Wii controller, a beamer, a laptop and you have to wear augmented ovengloves to play the game. The Wii remotoe tracks infrared light that is triggered by the custom-made gloves. The game itself is about popping bubbles and players coming into eachothers space. The main purpose is entertainment, but they also wanted to shed a different light on gaming, that it van be with physical contact. </p>
		<p>The play modus of this game is that is played with multiple people in a competitive. Therefore it is an interdependent exertion where the space is shared. This is because the players both stand in the space to pop the bubbles and can compete to conquer more space. But there is also a shared object, the screen.</p>

		<h3>Memo</h3>
		<p>In Twente people where thinking about how to get children back outside and play, instead of sitting at home watching movies or play videogames. They came with a solution including exertion gaming, Memo. Memo is a game that has the purpose of entertainment and getting a healthier lifestyle. They wanted children to play outside and thought of different poles that light up and turn off when someone touches it. Then other poles while light up and the children will have to touch the poles again to turn them off. The lights are interactive light touchscreens, that is why they react to the touch and turn off.</p>
		<p>This game can be played alone, but also with multiple people, also, it can be competitive or cooperative. It depends on how the users want to play this game. But, what is shared, is definitly the object. The poles are the game, there is no way around that and the children either need to work togheter or against eachother to turn off the lights as quick as possible.</p>
