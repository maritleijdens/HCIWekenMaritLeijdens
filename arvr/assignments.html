		<p>The second lecture was about Artificial Reality &amp; Virtual Reality, which is an artificial environment that is created with software and presented to the user in such a way that the user suspends belief and accepts it as a real environment.</p>

		<h3>Therapy</h3>
		<p>There are a lot of different types of therapy, for example there is haptonomy, a form of therapy which helps people with their problems by using the movements of their body and bringing them back to their selves. With AR&VR the patient could visualize different scenarios where it is important to be intact with your body, think of balancing on a plank or stand in a river stream. This could help giving the exercises more use for the patients that want to do it this way. Of course there will be people that do not like it, but that is the thing of therapy, everybody needs a different approach.</p>

		<h3>Public Transport</h3>
		<p>There are a lot of danger in the public transport nowadays. The busses need to go through a lot of small streets and the tourits aren't really helpful in this process. So to help the busdrivers, they will be simulated in a VR world and get to know the problems that can occur during a normal bustrip. The driver will have a steer that is connected to the VR, so that when the steer is rotating, the bus will make a turn and move along with the steer.</p>

		<h3>Sports/Movement</h3>
		<p>In the sportworld is eye-hand coordination an important factor. Think of baseball, fieldhockey, volleyball, handball and more. AR&amp;VR could be of use for improving this coordination. For the different types of sports, there are different versions, so it can be linked to the sport of the user. In the excersises there can be different approaches, for example, in a hockeygame you sometimes have to have someone on the goalline to help the goalkeeper from going the ball over the line. Therfor is eye-hand coordination essential. So there can be a simulation for this person, he or she stands on the goalline and there will be coming balls towards the person. He holds a stick and has to stop those balls. This way he can train stopping those balls, while they come harder and harder, while he is in no danger of getting the balls on his own body.</p>
