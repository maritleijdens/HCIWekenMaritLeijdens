		<h3>My expectations</h3>
		<p>Wearables are very popular these days and everybody has heard of them. When I think about wearables, I think mostly of watches, Apple smartwatch or Fitbits, but I know wearables are also stuff like glasses, eventhough those are not my first thought when I think of wearables.</p>
		<p>In the lecture I expect to see all different kinds of wearables, that are not glasses or watches, but something that you don't expect, bigger than a "normal" wearable.</p>
	</div>

		<h3>My impression</h3>
		<p>In the lecture there were a lot of examples of wearables and the most impressive one, were the PizzaHut shoes, were you can order pizza with one press on a button. This is a way bigger object than watches or glasses, but you wear them and they send out your order, what is interesting, that they only need your location, and your favourite pizza.</p>
		<p>Also the glasses and watches came back in the lecture, but that were the wearables I already know, stuff like the shoes, were new to me and those were really interesting and inspiring to me.</p>
	</div>

		<h3>Applications &amp; Future</h3>
		<p>When you see what kind of wearables there are already here, I think we can co a long way. One of the items I would like to see in the future are the shoes form Back to the Future, that lace themselves. That would be incredibly cool</p>
		<p>Next to shoes, wearables can also be of great use when it comes to growing up, at the moment wearables are being used for people to stay in shape, but it might also be used to life a happier life. For example, if the technology gets better it might recognize certain patterns in your day and find out if you were happy about those moment and bring back those moment when you need it.</p>
