		<p>Everybody nowadays knows what a wearable is, smartwatches, google glass, name it. Today I had a lecture about wearables and had to think of a new interactive wearable concept that stimulates interaction based on touch signals between people. What I thought of can be read below.</p>

		<h3>An easy conversation starter</h3>
		<p>There are a lot of people that find it hard to begin a conversation with strangers, what is a pity, because there are a lot of great people out here. That is why I would like to introduce a wearable that points you to someone in the same room, with the same interests. This helps with starting up a conversation, because you already have a subject to talk about. </p>

		<p>For example, you’re at a party where you don’t know a lot of people and want to talk to someone new. You just look at your watch and see that there are four persons near you with a shared interest, for example, football. You can tap on this person and ask if they want to have a chat, you can pick a spot or tell the other one how they can recognize you.</p> 

		<p>The watch works with the interests you put in, that is where it all starts. This can be done on the phone, which is synced to the watch. There you can give you interests and prioritize them, so the user can see their favorite topics first in the list. </p>

		<p>The screen on the watch is too small to chat on, so there are options you can send, for example, “what color are you wearing?”, “want to meet by the kitchen table?”. Then the one that receives the message can easily respond with a simple yes or no, or the color of the shirt the person is wearing.</p>

		<p>Beneath there are sketches of the wearable and the settings for the phone. </p>
